    "section": "Data Background",
    "text": "Data Background\nFor the Data Challenge, we have created 9000 different datasets, each of which was drawn from a distinct large population. These populations differ not only in terms of the treatment assignment probabilities but also in terms of the size of the treatment effects and the complexity/heterogeneity/functional form of the (conditional) average treatment effect functions. However, you may assume that treatment was assigned completely at random within each population. So, standard assumptions of ignorability and overlap are satisfied as is the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). Across all populations, you may assume that \\(A\\) represents the control or “business as usual” condition and that \\(B, C, D, E\\) represent different treatment arms.\nEach dataset contains \\(n\\) triplets \\((\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}, z_{i}, y_{i})\\) of $p = $ covariates \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{X}}\\), treatment indicator \\(Z \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E\\},\\) and outcome \\(Y.\\) You may assume that these triplets were drawn from a much larger population of size \\(N \\gg n.\\)\n\nCovariates\nThere are continuous, binary, and nominal covariates. You may assume that the distributions of the covariates are the same across all populations considered in this challenge.\n\n\nTarget Estimands\nFormally, each individual in the population has five potential outcomes \\(Y_{i}(A), Y_{i}(B), Y_{i}(C), Y_{i}(D), Y_{i}(E)\\), out of which exactly one is observed: \\(y_{i} = Y_{i}(z_{i}).\\) We will be interested in estimating four types of average treatment effects. First, we would like to estimate for each observed individual in the sample \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n,\\) their individual-level conditional average treatment effect for each \\(z \\in \\{B, C, D, E\\}\\): \\[\n\\textrm{iCATE}(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}, z) = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(z) - Y_{i}(A) \\vert \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{X}} = \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}].\n\\] The second type of effect is the sample average conditional average treatment effect for each \\(z \\in \\{B, C, D ,E\\}.\\) \\[\n\\textrm{sCATE}(z) = n^{-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(z) - Y_{i}(A) \\vert \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{X}} = \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}]}.\n\\]\nThe third type of effect is the sample average conditional treatment effect within subgroups defined by the value of \\(X_{12} \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) for each \\(z \\in \\{B,C,D,E\\}\\): \\[\n\\textrm{subCATE}(z,x) = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(z) - Y_{i}(A) \\vert \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{X}} = \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}] \\times \\mathbf{1}(x_{i,12} = x)}.\n\\] The fourth effect is the population conditional average treatment effect for each \\(z \\in \\{B,C,D,E\\}\\): \\[\n\\textrm{pCATE}(z) = N^{-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(z) - Y_{i}(A) \\vert \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{X}} = \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}]}.\n\\]\nIn addition to computing point estimates and pointwise uncertainty intervals for each of these effects, we are interested in determining which treatment is most effective relative to A, where positive treatment effect values are considered better/more effective than negative values. Specifically, we wish to compute the most effective treatment for\n\nEach individual \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\) in the sample: \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}\\), \\(\\textrm{argmax}_{z} \\textrm{iCATE}(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}, z).\\)\nOn average, across the observed sample:\\(\\textrm{argmax}_{z} \\textrm{sCATE}(z)\\)\nOn average, across the observed sample, within each subgroup defined by\\(X_{12} \\in \\{0,1\\}:\\) \\(\\textrm{argmax}_{z} \\textrm{subCATE}(z,x).\\)\nOn average, across the whole population: \\(\\textrm{argmax}_{z} \\textrm{pCATE}(z).\\)"
